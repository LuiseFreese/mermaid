# Mermaid to Dataverse Converter

A modern React-based Azure App Service application that converts [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) ERD diagrams into Microsoft Dataverse entities, columns, and relationships. Built with React 18, Fluent UI v9, and automated Azure deployment using managed identity.

## Key Features

- **Simple Web Interface**: Upload Mermaid files and deploy with a few clicks
- **Complete Schema Generation**: Creates publishers, solutions, entities, columns, and relationships
- **CDM Integration**: Automatically detects and maps to Microsoft Common Data Model entities
- **Smart Validation & Auto-Fix**: Real-time ERD validation with one-click fixes for common issues ([see all validations](docs/VALIDATION-AND-AUTOFIX.md))
- **Relationship Support**: One-to-many relationships and junction tables for many-to-many
- **Global Choice Integration**: Map to existing choice sets or create new ones
- **Deployment History**: Track all deployments with solution links and detailed entity information
- **Zero-Trust Security**: Managed identity authentication with no stored secrets
- **Multiple Themes**: Light mode, dark mode, pink mode üíñ, and retro neon mode üåà‚ú®

## Architecture

### Modern Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Fluent UI v9
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Build Tool**: Vite (development and production builds)
- **Cloud**: Azure App Service with Managed Identity
- **Security**: Federated credentials and managed identity for secure authentication
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Bicep templates for repeatable deployments

## Quick Start

**Two steps to deploy everything:**

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LuiseFreese/mermaid.git
cd mermaid

# Step 1: Create Azure infrastructure and identity setup
.\scripts\setup-secretless.ps1 -EnvironmentSuffix "myapp" -DataverseUrl "https://your-org.crm.dynamics.com" -Unattended

# Step 2: Deploy the application
.\scripts\deploy-secretless.ps1 -EnvironmentSuffix "myapp"
```

**The setup script will:**
- Create App Registration with federated credentials
- Deploy Azure infrastructure (App Service, Managed Identity, etc.)
- Configure secure managed identity authentication
- Set up Dataverse application user with proper permissions

**The deploy script will:**
- Build the React frontend locally
- Package only necessary backend files (no node_modules)
- Deploy to Azure App Service
- Configure proper static file serving


### Prerequisites
- Azure CLI installed and logged in (`az login`)
- Node.js 18+ (for local frontend build)
- Power Platform Admin or Dataverse System Admin access (for Dataverse integration)

## Usage

### Accessing the Application

1. **Open the React Wizard**: Navigate to your deployed App Service URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net`)
2. **Modern Interface**: Use the intuitive React-based wizard with Fluent UI components

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Upload ERD File
- **Browse**: Upload your `.mmd` file containing an ERD diagram
- **Real-time Validation**: Get immediate feedback on syntax and structure
- **Auto-corrections**: Review and apply suggested improvements
- **CDM Detection**: See if your entities match Common Data Model standards

#### Step 2: Configure Solution & Publisher
- **Solution Name**: Enter a name for your Dataverse solution
- **Publisher Selection**: Choose existing publisher or create new one
- **Publisher Prefix**: Set a 3-8 character prefix for custom entities
- **Validation**: Real-time checking for naming conflicts

#### Step 3: Global Choices (Optional)
- **Upload JSON**: Add custom global choice definitions
- **Preview Choices**: Review choice sets before deployment
- **Integration**: Map to existing Dataverse choices automatically

#### Step 4: Review & Deploy
- **Configuration Summary**: Review all settings before deployment
- **CDM Options**: Choose between CDM entities or custom entities
- **Real-time Progress**: Watch deployment progress with live updates
- **Success Confirmation**: Get detailed results of what was created

### Sample Diagram

```mermaid
erDiagram
    %% CDM Entities (will be detected and integrated - attributes will be ignored)
    Account {
        string name "Company name"
        string description "Company description"
        string accountnumber "Account number"
        string phone "Primary phone"
        string emailaddress1 "Primary email"
        string websiteurl "Website URL"
    }

    Contact {
        string fullname "Full name"
        string firstname "First name"
        string lastname "Last name"
        string emailaddress1 "Email address"
        string mobilephone "Mobile phone"
        string jobtitle "Job title"
    }

    %% Custom Entities (will be created)
    Event {
        int id PK
        string name "Event name"
        string description "Event description"
        string status "Event status"
        datetime startdate "Event start date"
        datetime enddate "Event end date"
        int maxattendees "Maximum attendees"
        int locationid FK "Location reference"
   
    }

    Location {
        int id PK
        string name "Location name"
        string description "Location description"
        string address "Street address"
        string city "City"
        string state "State/Province"
        string zipcode "ZIP/Postal code"
        string country "Country"
        int capacity "Maximum capacity"
        string status "Location status"

    }

    %% Intersection/Junction Table (Many-to-Many)
    EventAttendee {
        int id PK
        int eventid FK "Event reference"
        string attendeetype "Type: Account or Contact"
        int accountid FK "Account attendee"
        int contactid FK "Contact attendee"
        string status "Attendance status"
        datetime registrationdate "Registration date"
        string notes "Attendee notes"

    }

    %% Relationships
    Account ||--o{ EventAttendee : "attends events"
    Contact ||--o{ EventAttendee : "attends events"
    Event ||--o{ EventAttendee : "has attendees"
    Location ||--o{ Event : "hosts events"

```

**Result**: Creates `Event` and `Location` tables with `Eventattendee` table as a junction table and adds the `Contact` and `Account` table to the solution. Will automatically create all relationships as defined.

## Note on AI Usage

GitHub Copilot has been incredibly helpful in this project - especially for:

* Creating countless Mermaid diagrams
* Fleshing out examples
* Outlining documentation
* Writing debug and cleanup scripts
* Writing all the test cases
* Hardening deployments
* Code commenting
