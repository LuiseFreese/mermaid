# Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the Mermaid to Dataverse web application to transform Mermaid entity-relationship diagrams into Microsoft Dataverse solutions, tables, columns, and relationships.

## Overview

The application provides a **web interface** for uploading Mermaid ERD files and automatically creating corresponding Dataverse entities. No local installation or CLI commands required - everything runs in your browser!

## Prerequisites

✅ **Application URL** - Get this from your automated deployment  
✅ **Mermaid ERD file** (`.mmd` extension) with valid ER diagram syntax  
✅ **Dataverse environment** - Already configured during setup  

> 📝 **Note**: All authentication and environment setup is handled automatically. You just need your deployed application URL and a Mermaid file.

## Before You Start: Testing with Dry Run

🧪 **Recommended**: Before making actual changes to your Dataverse environment, test your setup and configuration using the dry run feature.

### Running Dry Run for Initial Setup

If you used the automated setup script, you can test the entire infrastructure deployment process:

```powershell
# Test deployment without making changes
.\scripts\setup-entra-app.ps1 -DryRun

# Or test with specific configuration
.\scripts\setup-entra-app.ps1 -DryRun -Unattended `
  -EnvironmentUrl "https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com" `
  -ResourceGroup "rg-mermaid" `
  -Location "East US"
```

The dry run will:
- ✅ Validate all your inputs and configuration
- ✅ Check Azure CLI access and permissions  
- ✅ Verify Dataverse environment connectivity
- ✅ Show exactly what would be created
- ✅ Provide the exact command to run for actual deployment

### Running Dry Run for Mermaid Processing

In the web application, always enable "Dry Run" first to preview what will be created:

1. **Upload your Mermaid file**
2. **Enable "Dry Run" checkbox**  
3. **Review the preview** of entities, columns, and relationships
4. **Run again without dry run** once you're satisfied

**Dry Run Output Example:**
```
🧪 DRY RUN MODE - No changes will be made to Dataverse

✅ File validation passed
✅ Entity structure valid
✅ Relationships valid
✅ Publisher prefix available

📋 Would create:
   - Solution: "Customer Management" 
   - Publisher: "cmgt" (Customer Management Publisher)
   - Entity: Customer (3 columns)
   - Entity: Order (4 columns)
   - Entity: Product (5 columns)
   - Relationship: Customer ||--o{ Order
   - Relationship: Order ||--o{ Product

🎯 Ready for actual deployment!
```

## Web Interface Features

### 📊 Status Dashboard

The application shows real-time status of all components:

- ✅ **Application Health**: Server status
- ✅ **Azure Key Vault**: Secret access  
- ✅ **Managed Identity**: Authentication status
- ✅ **Dataverse Connection**: API connectivity

### 🔍 Diagnostic Endpoints

Access additional diagnostic information:

- `/health` - Application health check
- `/keyvault` - Key Vault connectivity test
- `/managed-identity` - Authentication status
- `/api/validate` - Validate Mermaid files
- `/api/test-dataverse` - Test Dataverse operations

### 📋 Real-Time Logging

The web interface provides live feedback during processing:

- **File upload progress**
- **Parsing status**
- **Validation results**  
- **Entity creation progress**
- **Relationship establishment**
- **Final deployment summary**

## Quick Start

### 1. Access the Web Application

Navigate to your deployed application URL:
```
https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net
```

### 2. Upload Your Mermaid File

1. **Click "Choose File"** and select your `.mmd` file
2. **Configure options**:
   - **Solution Name**: Name for your Dataverse solution (e.g., "Customer Management")
   - **Publisher Prefix**: 3-8 character prefix (e.g., "cmgt")
   - **Dry Run**: Enable to preview without creating anything
3. **Click "Upload and Process"**

### 3. Monitor Real-Time Progress

Watch the live log output as your solution is created:

```

6. **Solution Creation**: Creates Dataverse solution container
7. **Entity Creation**: Creates tables with specified columns
8. **Relationship Creation**: Establishes entity relationships
9. **Summary**: Displays deployment results

## Supported Mermaid Syntax

### Basic Entity Example

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Customer {
        string customer_id PK
        string first_name
        string last_name
        string email UK
        datetime created_date
        boolean is_active
    }
```

### Supported Data Types

| Mermaid Type | Dataverse Type | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| `string` | Single Line Text | Max 255 characters |
| `integer` | Whole Number | Integer values |
| `decimal` | Decimal Number | Floating point |
| `boolean` | Yes/No | True/false values |
| `datetime` | Date and Time | Full timestamp |

### Supported Constraints

| Constraint | Meaning | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `PK` | Primary Key | Creates GUID primary key + name field |
| `FK` | Foreign Key | Will be used for relationship creation |
| `UK` | Unique Key | Creates unique constraint |

### Relationship Examples

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Customer ||--o{ Order : "places"
    Order ||--o{ OrderItem : "contains"
    Product ||--o{ OrderItem : "included_in"
    
    Customer {
        string customer_id PK
        string name
        string email UK
    }
    
    Order {
        string order_id PK
        string customer_id FK
        datetime order_date
        decimal total_amount
    }
    
    Product {
        string product_id PK
        string name
        decimal price
        boolean is_active
    }
    
    OrderItem {
        string item_id PK
        string order_id FK
        string product_id FK
        integer quantity
        decimal unit_price
    }
```

### Relationship Types Supported

- `||--o{` : One-to-many relationship
- `}o--o{` : Many-to-many relationship (creates junction table)
- `||--||` : One-to-one relationship

> **Note**: All relationships are created as **referential (lookup)** by default using Dataverse's native lookup relationship type. This prevents cascade delete conflicts and you can manually configure parental relationships in Dataverse if needed.

## Best Practices

### 📝 File Preparation
- **Use descriptive entity names**: `Customer`, `Order`, `Product`
- **Use snake_case for columns**: `first_name`, `created_date`, `is_active`
- **Use boolean prefixes**: `is_active`, `has_discount`, `can_edit`
- **Use descriptive suffixes**: `_date`, `_time`, `_amount`, `_count`
- **Keep file size reasonable**: Large ERDs may take longer to process

### 🧪 Testing Strategy
1. **Always start with Dry Run** to validate your ERD
2. **Test with small examples** before large deployments
3. **Review generated names** in the preview output
4. **Backup your Dataverse environment** before major deployments

### 🔄 Version Control
- **Store Mermaid files in source control** (Git, etc.)
- **Document your entity relationships** with meaningful names
- **Use consistent naming conventions** across projects
- **Tag versions** when deploying to production

### 🛡️ Safety Considerations
- **Publisher prefixes are permanent** - choose wisely
- **Entity names cannot be changed** after creation
- **Relationships default to referential** (safe, using native Dataverse lookup types)
- **Manual cleanup required** if deployment fails partway

## Example Files

The application works with any valid Mermaid ERD. Here are some examples:

### Simple CRM Example
```mermaid
erDiagram
    Contact {
        string contact_id PK
        string first_name
        string last_name
        string email UK
        string phone
        datetime created_date
        boolean is_active
    }
    
    Company {
        string company_id PK
        string company_name
        string website
        string industry
        integer employee_count
    }
    
    Contact ||--o{ Company : "works_for"
```

### E-commerce Example
```mermaid
erDiagram
    Customer ||--o{ Order : "places"
    Order ||--o{ OrderItem : "contains"
    Product ||--o{ OrderItem : "appears_in"
    
    Customer {
        string customer_id PK
        string email UK
        string first_name
        string last_name
        datetime created_date
        boolean is_premium
    }
    
    Product {
        string product_id PK
        string name
        string description
        decimal price
        integer stock_quantity
        boolean is_available
    }
    
    Order {
        string order_id PK
        string customer_id FK
        datetime order_date
        decimal total_amount
        string status
    }
    
    OrderItem {
        string item_id PK
        string order_id FK
        string product_id FK
        integer quantity
        decimal unit_price
    }
```

## Validation & Error Handling

### Built-in Validation
The application automatically validates:

- ✅ **File format**: Must be valid Mermaid ERD syntax
- ✅ **Entity structure**: Each entity must have at least one primary key
- ✅ **Relationship validity**: References must point to existing entities
- ✅ **Naming conventions**: Publisher prefix format validation
- ✅ **Dataverse limits**: Column names, solution names, etc.

### Common Validation Messages
```
🔍 Validating ERD structure...
✅ All entities have primary keys
✅ No self-references detected
✅ All relationship targets exist
ℹ️ All relationships will be created as referential (lookup) using Dataverse's native lookup relationship behavior
✅ Validation completed successfully
```

### Error Examples
```
❌ Entity 'Order' references unknown entity 'InvalidEntity'
❌ Entity 'Customer' has no primary key defined
❌ Publisher prefix must be 3-8 characters (got: 'ab')
❌ Solution name cannot contain special characters
```

## Troubleshooting

### File Upload Issues
```
❌ File upload failed: File too large
```
**Solutions**: 
- Check file size (limit: ~10MB)
- Ensure file has `.mmd` extension
- Verify file contains valid Mermaid syntax

### Authentication Issues
```
❌ Dataverse connection failed: Unauthorized
```
**Solutions**:
- Check application health status on the dashboard
- Verify Dataverse environment is accessible
- Contact administrator if managed identity issues persist

### Entity Creation Issues
```
❌ Entity creation failed: Publisher prefix invalid
```
**Solutions**:
- Use 3-8 character publisher prefix
- Only lowercase letters allowed
- Ensure prefix doesn't conflict with existing publishers
- Try different solution name if conflicts exist

### Performance Considerations
- **Large ERDs**: May take several minutes to process
- **Many relationships**: Processing time increases with complexity
- **Network latency**: Depends on Dataverse environment location
- **Browser timeout**: For very large deployments, monitor progress actively
