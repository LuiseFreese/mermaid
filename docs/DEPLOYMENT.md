# Deployment Guide - Mermaid to Dataverse Converter

This guide explains how to deploy and use the Mermaid-to-Dataverse application. The application uses **fully automated setup** with managed identity authentication - no manual configuration required!

## Quick Start (Recommended)

**Two steps to deploy everything:**

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LuiseFreese/mermaid.git
cd mermaid

# Step 1: Create Azure infrastructure and identity setup
.\scripts\setup-secretless.ps1 -EnvironmentSuffix "myapp" -DataverseUrl "https://your-org.crm.dynamics.com" -Unattended

# Step 2: Deploy the application code
.\scripts\deploy-secretless.ps1 -EnvironmentSuffix "myapp"
```

**The setup script will:**
- Create App Registration with federated credentials
- Deploy Azure infrastructure (App Service, Managed Identity, etc.)
- Configure secure managed identity authentication
- Set up Dataverse application user with proper permissions

**The deploy script will:**
- Build the React frontend locally using Vite
- Package only necessary backend files (no node_modules)
- Deploy to Azure App Service with proper static file serving
- Configure runtime settings for optimal performance

## Prerequisites

Before running the setup:

1. **Azure subscription** with permissions to create resources
2. **PowerShell 7+** (recommended) or Windows PowerShell 5.1
3. **Azure CLI** installed and logged in (`az login`)
4. **Node.js 18+** (required for local frontend build)
5. **Access to Dataverse environment** where you want to create entities
6. **Appropriate permissions**:
   - **Azure**: Contributor or Owner on subscription
   - **Microsoft Entra ID**: Application Administrator (to create app registrations)
   - **Dataverse**: System Administrator (to create application users and assign System Customizer role)

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Infrastructure Setup
```powershell
# Interactive mode (prompts for configuration)
.\scripts\setup-secretless.ps1

# OR unattended mode (provide all parameters)
.\scripts\setup-secretless.ps1 -Unattended `
  -EnvironmentSuffix "myapp" `
  -DataverseUrl "https://orgXXXXX.crm4.dynamics.com"
```

### Step 2: Application Deployment
```powershell
# Deploy the application code to existing infrastructure
.\scripts\deploy-secretless.ps1 -EnvironmentSuffix "myapp"
```


## What Gets Deployed

The setup script automatically creates:

- **Azure Resource Group** - Container for all resources
- **App Service & App Service Plan** - Web application hosting (Linux, Node.js 20)
- **User-Assigned Managed Identity** - Secure authentication with federated credentials
- **Entra ID App Registration** - Service principal for Dataverse access
- **Dataverse Application User** - Configured with appropriate security roles

## Automated Setup Process

The **setup script** (`scripts/setup-secretless.ps1`) creates the infrastructure:

1. **Creates App Registration** with proper configuration and federated credentials
2. **Deploys Infrastructure** using Bicep (Managed Identity, App Service)
3. **Configures federated credentials** for secure token exchange
4. **Stores configuration** in App Service application settings
5. **Creates Application User** in Dataverse via REST API
6. **Assigns Security Roles** (System Customizer by default)

The **deployment script** (`scripts/deploy-secretless.ps1`) handles the application:

1. **Builds React frontend** locally using Vite for optimal performance
2. **Packages backend code** (excludes node_modules and source files)
3. **Deploys to Azure App Service** using Azure CLI with proper static file configuration
4. **Configures runtime settings** for managed identity integration and static asset serving
5. **Validates deployment** by testing the application endpoints

### Security-First Deployment Approach

The deployment process uses a **security-first approach** with managed identity authentication:

- **No secrets required** - Managed identity provides passwordless authentication
- **Secure environment variables** - Configuration stored in App Service settings
- **Federated credentials** - Token exchange without storing secrets
- **Zero hardcoded secrets** - All authentication handled by Azure managed identity

### Interactive Setup Example

**Step 1: Infrastructure Setup**
```powershell
PS> .\scripts\setup-entra-app.ps1

Mermaid to Dataverse - Infrastructure Setup
===========================================

Find your Dataverse Environment URL at make.powerapps.com > Settings > Session details, copy the **Instance URL**

Dataverse Environment URL: https://orgxxxxxxx.crm4.dynamics.com
Resource Group Name: rg-mermaid-dv-we-test
Azure Region: westeurope
App Registration Name: Mermaid-Dataverse-Converter
App Service Name: app-mermaid-dv-we-5678

âœ… App Registration created successfully
âœ… Infrastructure deployed successfully  
âœ… Managed identity configured
âœ… Dataverse Application User created
âœ… Security roles assigned

ðŸŽ‰ Infrastructure Setup Complete!
Next: Run the deploy script to deploy your application code.
```

**Step 2: Application Deployment**
```powershell
PS> .\scripts\deploy-secretless.ps1 -EnvironmentSuffix "5678"

Mermaid to Dataverse - Application Deployment
============================================

âœ… Building React frontend with Vite...
âœ… Packaging backend code...
âœ… Deploying to Azure App Service...
âœ… Configuring static file serving...
âœ… Application deployed successfully!

ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Complete! Application ready at: 
   https://app-mermaid-dv-we-5678.azurewebsites.net/

ðŸ”’ Security Features:
   - Managed Identity for passwordless authentication
   - Federated credentials for secure token exchange
   - Zero secrets stored anywhere in the system
```

## Infrastructure as Code

All Azure resources are defined in `deploy/infrastructure.bicep`

## Security Architecture

The deployment uses **enterprise-grade security** with multiple layers of protection:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User-Assigned Managed Identity**: Passwordless authentication for secure token access
- **Federated Credentials**: Secure token exchange without storing secrets
- **Entra ID App Registration**: Service principal configured for managed identity
- **Application User**: Dedicated Dataverse user with specific security roles

### Configuration Management
- **App Service Settings**: Configuration stored as environment variables
- **No secrets required**: All authentication handled through Azure managed identity
- **Zero hardcoded values**: Configuration managed through Azure portal or deployment scripts

### Deployment Security
- **Parameter-free deployment**: No secrets passed as command-line parameters
- **Azure CLI authentication**: Uses your existing Azure session for secure operations
- **Managed identity authentication**: All security handled through Azure identity services
- **Audit trail**: All operations logged through Azure Activity Log

### Runtime Security
- **Managed Identity authentication**: App uses managed identity for all external service access
- **Environment variables**: Configuration stored securely in App Service settings
- **HTTPS only**: All communication encrypted in transit
- **Network isolation**: App Service can be configured with VNet integration

## Deploying Code Updates

After the initial infrastructure setup, you can deploy code changes using the deploy script:

```powershell
# Deploy code updates to existing infrastructure
.\scripts\deploy-secretless.ps1 -EnvironmentSuffix "myapp"
```

This script will:
1. **Build React frontend** locally using Vite for optimal performance
2. **Package backend code** (excludes node_modules and source files for faster deployment)
3. **Deploy to Azure App Service** using Azure CLI with proper static file configuration
4. **Configure runtime settings** for managed identity integration and static asset serving
5. **Test deployment** by verifying the application endpoints
6. **Clean up temporary files** for security

### Security Benefits

The deployment process ensures **zero secrets required**:
- No secrets stored anywhere in the system
- Managed Identity provides secure, passwordless authentication
- All configuration stored as environment variables in App Service
- Federated credentials enable secure token exchange

### Idempotent Deployments

Both scripts are **idempotent** and can be run multiple times safely:

```powershell
# Re-run infrastructure setup (detects existing resources)
.\scripts\setup-secretless.ps1 -EnvironmentSuffix "myapp"

# Re-run application deployment (updates code only)
.\scripts\deploy-secretless.ps1 -EnvironmentSuffix "myapp"
```

**Infrastructure script will:**
- Detect existing resources and reuse them
- Only create missing components
- Preserve existing configuration
- Update secrets if needed

**Deployment script will:**
- Always deploy fresh application code
- Rebuild frontend for latest changes
- Update runtime configuration
- Ensure optimal performance
