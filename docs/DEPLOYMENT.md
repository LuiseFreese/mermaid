# Deployment Guide - Mermaid to Dataverse Converter

This guide explains how to deploy and use the Mermaid-to-Dataverse application. The application uses **fully automated setup** - no manual configuration required!

## Quick Start (Recommended)

**One command deploys everything:**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/LuiseFreese/mermaid.git
cd mermaid
./scripts/setup-entra-app.ps1
```

The script will prompt you for configuration and handle all setup automatically.

## What You Get

After setup, you'll have a **complete working application** that:
- âœ… Converts Mermaid ERD files to Dataverse entities
- âœ… Provides a web interface for file uploads
- âœ… Shows real-time processing logs
- âœ… Supports dry-run mode for validation
- âœ… Uses enterprise-grade security (Managed Identity + Key Vault)

## Prerequisites

Before running the setup:

1. **Azure subscription** with permissions to create resources
2. **PowerShell 7+** (recommended) or Windows PowerShell 5.1
3. **Azure CLI** installed and logged in (`az login`)
4. **Access to Dataverse environment** where you want to create entities
5. **Appropriate permissions**:
   - **Azure**: Contributor or Owner on subscription
   - **Microsoft Entra ID**: Application Administrator (to create app registrations)
   - **Dataverse**: System Administrator (to create application users)

## Deployment Options

### Interactive Mode (Recommended for First-Time Users)
```powershell
# Interactive mode (prompts for configuration)
.\scripts\setup-entra-app.ps1
```

### Unattended Mode (For Automation)
```powershell
# Unattended mode (provide all parameters)
.\scripts\setup-entra-app.ps1 -Unattended `
  -EnvironmentUrl "https://orgXXXXX.crm4.dynamics.com" `
  -ResourceGroup "rg-mermaid-dataverse" `
  -Location "westeurope" `
  -AppRegistrationName "Mermaid-Dataverse-Converter" `
  -AppServiceName "app-mermaid-dv-we-1234" `
  -KeyVaultName "kv-mermaid-secrets-1234" `
  -SecurityRole "System Administrator"
```


## What Gets Deployed

The setup script automatically creates:

- **Azure Resource Group** - Container for all resources
- **App Service & App Service Plan** - Web application hosting (Linux, Node.js 20)
- **Key Vault** - Secure secret storage with RBAC
- **User-Assigned Managed Identity** - Secure authentication without passwords
- **Entra ID App Registration** - Service principal for Dataverse access
- **Dataverse Application User** - Configured with appropriate security roles

## Automated Setup Process

The setup script (`scripts/setup-entra-app.ps1`) performs these tasks automatically:

1. **Creates App Registration** with proper configuration (using latest Azure CLI syntax)
2. **Generates Client Secret** with 2-year expiration (securely, without console exposure)
3. **Deploys Infrastructure** using Bicep (Key Vault, Managed Identity, App Service)
4. **Configures RBAC permissions** for Key Vault access
5. **Stores all secrets** securely in Key Vault
6. **Deploys application code** to Azure App Service using secure secret retrieval
7. **Creates Application User** in Dataverse via REST API
8. **Assigns Security Roles** (System Administrator by default)
9. **Tests the complete setup** end-to-end

### Security-First Deployment Approach

The deployment process uses a **security-first approach** that eliminates exposure of sensitive data:

- **No secrets in command line parameters** - Prevents exposure in process lists or command history
- **Direct Key Vault retrieval** - Secrets are retrieved from Key Vault during deployment using Azure CLI
- **Managed Identity authentication** - No stored credentials required for Key Vault access
- **Fallback environment variables** - Securely set from Key Vault for runtime backup
- **Zero hardcoded secrets** - All sensitive data flows through Azure's secure services

### Interactive Setup Example

```powershell
Mermaid to Dataverse - Interactive Setup
=========================================

Find your Dataverse Environment URL  at make.powerapps.com > Settings > Session details, copy the **Instance URL**

Dataverse Environment URL: https://orgxxxxxxx.crm4.dynamics.com
Resource Group Name: rg-mermaid-dv-we-test
Azure Region: westeurope
App Registration Name: Mermaid-Dataverse-Converter
App Service Name: app-mermaid-dv-we-5678
Key Vault Name: kv-mermaid-secrets-5678

âœ… App Registration created successfully
âœ… Infrastructure deployed successfully  
âœ… Application code deployed successfully (with secure secret management)
âœ… Secrets stored in Key Vault
âœ… Dataverse Application User created
âœ… Security roles assigned

ðŸŽ‰ Setup Complete! Application ready at: 
   https://app-mermaid-dv-we-5678.azurewebsites.net/

ðŸ”’ Security Features:
   - All secrets secured in Azure Key Vault
   - Managed Identity for passwordless authentication
   - Zero hardcoded credentials in deployment process
```

## Infrastructure as Code

All Azure resources are defined in `deploy/infrastructure.bicep`

## Security Architecture

The deployment uses **enterprise-grade security** with multiple layers of protection:

### Secret Management
- **Azure Key Vault**: All sensitive data (client secrets, URLs) stored securely
- **No hardcoded secrets**: Zero secrets in source code, configuration files, or deployment scripts
- **Secure retrieval**: Secrets fetched directly from Key Vault during deployment using Azure CLI
- **Runtime Key Vault integration**: App retrieves secrets at runtime using Managed Identity

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User-Assigned Managed Identity**: Passwordless authentication for App Service â†” Key Vault
- **RBAC permissions**: Principle of least privilege for Key Vault access
- **Entra ID App Registration**: Secure service principal for Dataverse access
- **Application User**: Dedicated Dataverse user with specific security roles

### Deployment Security
- **Parameter-free deployment**: No secrets passed as command-line parameters
- **Azure CLI authentication**: Uses your existing Azure session for secure operations
- **Temporary secret exposure**: Secrets only retrieved when needed during deployment
- **Audit trail**: All operations logged through Azure Activity Log

### Runtime Security
- **Primary**: App uses Managed Identity to fetch secrets from Key Vault
- **Fallback**: Secure environment variables set during deployment (also from Key Vault)
- **HTTPS only**: All communication encrypted in transit
- **Network isolation**: App Service can be configured with VNet integration

## Deploying Code Updates

After the initial setup, you can deploy code changes using the deploy script:

```powershell
# Deploy code updates to existing infrastructure
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -AppServiceName "app-mermaid-dv-we-5678" -ResourceGroup "rg-mermaid-dv-we-test"
```

This script will:
1. **Securely retrieve secrets** from Key Vault using Azure CLI
2. Create a deployment package with your application code
3. Deploy the package to your Azure App Service using Oryx build
4. Configure app settings with Key Vault integration and secure fallback values
5. Assign Managed Identity for secure Key Vault access
6. Clean up temporary files

### Security Benefits

The deployment process ensures **zero exposure of sensitive data**:
- Secrets are retrieved directly from Key Vault during deployment
- No secrets appear in command parameters, process lists, or logs
- Managed Identity provides secure, passwordless authentication
- Fallback environment variables are set securely from Key Vault

### Zero-Downtime Updates

The setup script is **idempotent** - it can be run multiple times safely:

```powershell
# Re-run setup to update existing deployment
./scripts/setup-entra-app.ps1

# The script will:
# - Detect existing resources and reuse them
# - Update application code if needed
# - Only create missing components
# - Preserve existing configuration
```

## Using Your Deployed Application

After the automated setup completes, you can start using the application:

### 1. Access Your Application
Visit the URL provided by the setup script:
```
https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net
```

### 2. Upload Mermaid Files
- Use the web interface to upload `.mmd` files
- Start with **dry-run mode** to validate your files
- Review the real-time processing logs
- Switch to **live mode** to create actual Dataverse entities

### 3. Monitor and Manage
- Check the status dashboard for system health
- Use diagnostic endpoints to troubleshoot issues
- View created entities in your Dataverse environment

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Read the Usage Guide**: See [USAGE-GUIDE.md](USAGE-GUIDE.md) for how to use the application
2. **Try Examples**: Test with sample files in the `examples/` folder
3. **Understand Mermaid Syntax**: Review [MERMAID-GUIDE.md](MERMAID-GUIDE.md) for supported ERD syntax
4. **Learn About Relationships**: See [RELATIONSHIP_TYPES.md](RELATIONSHIP_TYPES.md) for relationship modeling
