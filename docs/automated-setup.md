# Automated Dataverse Application User Setup

## Overview

This documentation describes the fully automated setup script that solves the "chicken and egg" problem of creating Dataverse Application Users. The script can bootstrap a complete environment from scratch without any manual intervention.

## Features

### üîÑ Complete Automation
- **App Registration Management**: Automatically creates or updates Azure AD app registrations
- **Credential Management**: Generates fresh client secrets and updates `.env` file automatically  
- **Service Principal Creation**: Creates and configures service principals
- **Application User Bootstrap**: Uses admin credentials to create the first Application User when needed
- **Role Assignment**: Automatically assigns System Administrator role
- **Self-Healing**: Handles stale credentials and authentication failures gracefully

### üõ°Ô∏è Chicken-and-Egg Problem Solution
The script intelligently handles the bootstrap scenario:

1. **Service Principal First**: Tries to authenticate using existing service principal credentials
2. **Admin Fallback**: If service principal auth fails (first-time setup), automatically falls back to Azure CLI admin authentication
3. **Bootstrap Creation**: Uses admin credentials to create the Application User for the service principal
4. **Validation**: Tests that service principal authentication works after Application User creation
5. **Future Runs**: Subsequent runs use service principal authentication (no admin required)

### ‚ö° Idempotent Operations
- **No Duplicates**: Checks for existing resources and avoids creating duplicates
- **Safe Re-runs**: Can be run multiple times safely
- **Credential Refresh**: Automatically generates fresh secrets when needed
- **State Recovery**: Handles partially completed setups gracefully

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

```bash
# 1. Azure CLI installed and logged in as admin
az login

# 2. Verify admin access
az account show

# 3. .env file with minimum required variables
DATAVERSE_URL=https://your-org.crm4.dynamics.com
TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
```

The script will automatically create `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` if they don't exist.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run the complete automation
node scripts/setup-application-user.cjs
```

### What the Script Does

#### Phase 1: App Registration Management
1. **Check Existing**: Searches for existing "Mermaid Luise Auto" app registration
2. **Create if Missing**: Creates new app registration, service principal, and secret if none exists
3. **Update Credentials**: Generates fresh client secret if app registration exists
4. **Update .env**: Automatically updates the `.env` file with new credentials
5. **MSAL Refresh**: Reinitializes authentication client with new credentials

#### Phase 2: Authentication Strategy
1. **Service Principal Auth**: Attempts to authenticate using service principal
2. **Admin Fallback**: If service principal fails, uses Azure CLI admin authentication
3. **Bootstrap Mode**: Clearly indicates when using admin credentials for first-time setup

#### Phase 3: Application User Management
1. **Cleanup Duplicates**: Removes any existing duplicate Application Users
2. **Check Existing**: Verifies if Application User already exists for the service principal
3. **Create User**: Creates Application User if it doesn't exist
4. **Assign Role**: Assigns System Administrator role to the Application User
5. **Validate**: Tests that service principal authentication now works

#### Phase 4: Verification
1. **Authentication Test**: Calls the publishers endpoint to verify full access
2. **Success Confirmation**: Provides clear feedback about the automation status
3. **Future Guidance**: Explains that future runs will use service principal authentication

## Output Examples

### First-Time Setup (Bootstrap)
```
Starting Application User setup...
Checking for existing app registration...
No app registration found, creating from scratch...
Creating new app registration...
App registration created: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
Creating service principal...
Service principal created
Client secret generated
New app registration created and configured
CLIENT_ID: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc
CLIENT_SECRET: AbCdEf1234...

‚ö†Ô∏è Service principal authentication failed (expected for first-time setup)
üîÑ Switching to admin authentication to bootstrap Application User...
üîê Falling back to admin authentication via Azure CLI...
This is needed to create the first Application User (chicken-and-egg problem)
‚úÖ Admin access token obtained

üë§ Creating Application User for service principal...
Application User created
System Administrator role assigned
üéâ Application User setup completed successfully!

üîÑ Testing service principal authentication after Application User creation...
‚úÖ Service principal authentication is now working!
üîß Chicken-and-egg problem resolved - future runs will use service principal auth

Authentication test successful
üìã Dataverse Publishers
=======================
‚úÖ Found 12 publishers
```

### Subsequent Runs
```
Starting Application User setup...
Checking for existing app registration...
Found existing app registration
App registration exists, generating fresh secret...
Fresh secret generated
Credentials updated, restarting process with fresh authentication...
‚úÖ Service principal authentication successful
‚úÖ Application User already exists
Authentication test successful
```

## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling:

### Common Scenarios
- **Missing Azure CLI**: Clear error message with installation instructions
- **Not Logged In**: Prompts to run `az login`
- **Insufficient Permissions**: Explains admin requirements
- **Network Issues**: Timeout handling for Azure CLI commands
- **Stale Credentials**: Automatic credential refresh and retry
- **Partial Setup**: Recovery from incomplete previous runs

### Troubleshooting

#### Script Hangs During App Registration Creation
```bash
# Check Azure CLI connectivity
az account show

# Try manual app creation to test
az ad app create --display-name "TestApp" --query "appId" --output tsv
```

#### Service Principal Authentication Fails
The script automatically handles this by falling back to admin authentication. If issues persist:
```bash
# Verify admin login
az account show

# Check Dataverse URL is correct
echo $DATAVERSE_URL
```

#### Application User Creation Fails
```bash
# Verify you have admin permissions in Dataverse
# Check that the Dataverse URL is accessible
# Ensure Azure CLI has the correct tenant context
```

## File Structure

```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup-application-user.cjs     # Main automation script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin-create-application-user.cjs  # Admin-only bootstrap script (legacy)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ simple-application-user-setup.cjs  # Simplified script (legacy)

.env                                # Configuration file (auto-updated)
```

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- **Automatic Rotation**: Client secrets are regenerated on each run
- **Secure Storage**: Credentials stored only in `.env` file (add to `.gitignore`)
- **Minimal Permissions**: Service principal gets only necessary Dataverse access
- **Admin Separation**: Admin credentials only used for initial bootstrap

### Best Practices
1. **Add .env to .gitignore**: Never commit credentials to source control
2. **Regular Rotation**: Re-run script periodically to refresh credentials
3. **Audit Access**: Monitor Application User activity in Dataverse
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Service principal has only required permissions

## Integration with Mermaid to Dataverse Converter

After successful setup, you can use the Mermaid to Dataverse converter:

```bash
# Convert ERD to Dataverse solution
node src/index.js convert --input your-diagram.mmd --solution "YourSolution"

# List available publishers
node src/index.js publishers

# Create custom entities
node src/index.js convert --input your-diagram.mmd --solution "YourSolution" --publisher-prefix "your"
```

## Summary
